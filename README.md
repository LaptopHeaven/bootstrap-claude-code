# Bootstrap Claude Code

**The missing link between Claude and your development projects.**

## The Problem

Every time you start a new project, you face the same time-consuming setup:
- Configuring build tools, testing frameworks, and quality gates
- Setting up project structure and development workflows  
- Integrating with Claude for AI-powered development
- Ensuring consistency across different projects and team members

Hours later, you're finally ready to write actual code.

## The Solution

Bootstrap Claude Code eliminates project setup friction by providing **ready-to-use project templates** that integrate seamlessly with Claude's development workflow.

**In 30 seconds, get:**
- âœ… Complete project structure with testing and quality tools
- âœ… Claude TDD + Scrumban workflow for efficient AI-powered development
- âœ… Cross-platform development scripts and automation
- âœ… Consistent setup across Python and .NET projects

## Who This Is For

**Individual developers** who want to:
- Start projects faster with consistent, quality setups
- Leverage Claude more effectively in their development workflow
- Avoid the tedium of manual project configuration

**Small development teams** who need:
- Standardized project structures across team members
- Shared development practices and tooling
- Consistent Claude integration patterns

## Quick Start

### Python Projects

```bash
# Linux/macOS/WSL
./bootstrap-claude-python.sh my-python-app -d "My awesome Python application"

# Windows PowerShell  
.\bootstrap-claude-python.ps1 MyPythonApp -Description "My awesome Python application"
```

### .NET 8 Projects

```bash
# Linux/macOS/WSL
./bootstrap-claude-dotnet.sh my-dotnet-api -d "REST API service" -t webapi

# Windows PowerShell
.\bootstrap-claude-dotnet.ps1 MyDotNetApi -Description "REST API service" -ProjectType webapi
```

**That's it!** Your project is ready with testing, quality tools, and Claude integration.

## What You Get

### Complete Project Setup
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest (Python) or xUnit (.NET) with coverage reporting
- **Code quality**: Formatters, linters, type checkers, and pre-commit hooks
- **Build automation**: Cross-platform scripts for build, test, and quality checks
- **Documentation**: README templates and development guides

### Claude TDD + Scrumban Integration
- **Structured workflow files** in `.claude/` directory for AI-powered development
- **Session management** with sign-in/sign-out protocols
- **Scrumban board** for tracking development tasks
- **Domain contexts** for better AI understanding of your project

### Cross-Platform Support
- **Bash scripts** for Linux, macOS, and WSL environments
- **PowerShell scripts** for native Windows development
- **Identical functionality** across both platforms

## Supported Project Types

### Python
- **Virtual environments** with dependency management
- **Package structure** following Python best practices
- **pytest** with coverage, mocking, and async support
- **Quality tools**: Black, flake8, mypy, isort

### .NET 8
- **Solution structure** with class libraries, console apps, or web APIs
- **xUnit testing** with FluentAssertions and Moq
- **Code analysis** with EditorConfig and analyzers
- **NuGet packages** and dependency management

## Example: From Zero to Coding in 30 Seconds

```bash
# 1. Create project (10 seconds)
./bootstrap-claude-python.sh my-ml-project -d "Machine learning experiment"

# 2. Navigate and activate (5 seconds)
cd my-ml-project
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Start developing with Claude (15 seconds)
# - Open .claude/CLAUDE.md for development workflow
# - Run ./scripts/test.sh to verify setup
# - Begin TDD cycle with Claude assistance
```

**Result**: Fully configured project with testing, quality tools, Git repository, and Claude workflow integration.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Module Combinations

For specific workflows, you can use individual modules:

```bash
# Python project without Claude workflow
./examples/custom-bootstrap.sh simple my-lib "Simple Python library"

# Add Claude workflow to existing project
./examples/custom-bootstrap.sh add-claude existing-project

# .NET Web API with full Claude integration
./examples/custom-bootstrap-dotnet.sh webapi my-api "REST API service"
```

### Project Types

**Python Options:**
- Any Python version (default: 3.12)
- Custom project descriptions
- Virtual environment isolation

**\\.NET Options:**
- `classlib` - Class library (default)
- `console` - Console application  
- `webapi` - ASP.NET Core Web API
- `mvc` - ASP.NET Core MVC
- `api` - Minimal API

## Requirements

### All Platforms
- Git (for repository management)

### Python Projects
- Python 3.11+ (3.12 recommended)

### .NET Projects  
- .NET 8 SDK

### Platform Requirements
- **Windows**: PowerShell 5.1+ (PowerShell 7+ recommended)
- **Linux/macOS/WSL**: Bash shell
- **Cross-platform**: Both implementations provide identical functionality

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LaptopHeaven/bootstrap-claude-code.git
   cd bootstrap-claude-code
   ```

2. **Make scripts executable (Linux/macOS/WSL):**
   ```bash
   chmod +x bootstrap-claude-python.sh bootstrap-claude-dotnet.sh
   ```

3. **Start bootstrapping projects!**

## Why Bootstrap Claude Code?

### Time Savings
- **No more setup friction**: Projects ready in seconds, not hours
- **Consistent environments**: Same quality standards across all projects  
- **Reduced context switching**: Focus on code, not configuration

### Quality Assurance
- **Battle-tested setups**: Proven project structures and tool configurations
- **Quality gates**: Automated testing, formatting, and analysis
- **Best practices**: Following language-specific conventions and patterns

### Claude Integration
- **Structured AI workflow**: Maximize Claude's effectiveness with organized development patterns
- **Session continuity**: Maintain context across development sessions
- **Collaborative development**: AI-assisted TDD and planning workflows

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! This project focuses on **Python and .NET support** with proven, maintainable implementations.

### Development Principles
- **Quality over quantity**: Better to support 2 languages excellently than 10 poorly
- **User-first design**: Optimize for developer experience and workflow efficiency  
- **Cross-platform consistency**: Identical functionality across Bash and PowerShell

### Getting Started
